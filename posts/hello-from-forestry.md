# Introduction

This seems to be quite a nice interface.

## Thoughts on Setup

Setting up new types of objects is quick and easy. I was able to convert this blog over to [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io) in a matter of minutes. I was blogging and creating new entries almost immediately.

## Content Management

You can create and manage new categories of content using the amazing UI built into the system. No more having to editing the raw `.yaml` files.

## Interface

The user interface is slick. I love it! The editing experience is responsive which is nice for editing on a mobile device. It is inviting to non-developers.

## Netlify CMS to Forestry.io

I was previously deploying and managing my blog with the built in Netlify CMS hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). I found their documentation to be clunky and at times hard to understand. (This might be a me problem). Forestry.io has simple and easy to read documentation The interface to manage and create new types of content are intuitive.

## Final Thoughts

I think I'll try out Forestry.io for a month or so and give another comparison at the end of September. Ultimately try both and use what works for your team and clients.
